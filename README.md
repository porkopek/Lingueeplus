# Lingueeplus
Linguee+ is an extension that sorts the search results in Linguee according to the sites from which they came.
In other words, if there is a site where we know that its texts are of better quality, we can add a part of the name of that site to Linguee+ as a filter and the results of that site will appear earlier, surrounded by a black border, for a better visualization.

For example:
It is well known that the European Union website, EUR-LEX, is a trusted source. If we want EUR-LEX results to appear first, we just have to enter "eur" as a filter, for example,  or "eur-lex"  (without quotation marks), since the url from which these results come is eur-lex. europa. eu.

Also, if we want to focus the search box with the keyboard, pressing the Escape key will access it.
In addition, Linguee+ increases font size to 20px for a better experience
